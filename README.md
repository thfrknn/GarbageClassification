<h1 align="center">Garbage Classification with Deep Learning </h1>


<h3 align="left">Overview</h3>

This repository contains code for a deep learning model to classify various types of garbage using a dataset available on Kaggle. The goal is to develop a robust model capable of accurately identifying and classifying garbage types to support waste management and recycling efforts.

<h3 align="left">Dataset</h3>

The dataset used in this project is available at Kaggle Garbage Classification Dataset. It includes images of different types of waste and is organized into several categories.
